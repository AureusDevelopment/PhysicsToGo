# ^^^ DEVELOPER NOTES ^^^
#
# YOU CAN GENERALIZE LIST VALUES. FOR EXAMPLE, ENTERING "MINECART" IN AN ENTITY BLOCK LIST WILL BLOCK ALL ENTITIES THAT CONTAIN THE WORD "MINECART"
# IN THEIR ENTITY TYPE NAME.

# The "block-in-claims" option is an extra step which will not perform any PTG tasks in supported claims found from other plugins under any circumstance.
block-in-claims: false

# The "state-override" option determines if actions such as explosives, placing, or break of existing locations where regeneration effects are scheduled will be allowed to merge.
# (For Example: When a player breaks a block and it is scheduled to regenerate, this will allow them to place block at that same location etc.)
state-override: false

# The "block-forming" option tells the plugin whether falling blocks created from physics can form on the ground
# upon impact or not (falling blocks spawned by the plugin).
block-forming: false

# The "container-restoration" option tells the plugin whether containers should be roleld back to prior the explosion or not.
container-restoration: true

# The "sign-restoration" option tells the plugin whether signs should be roleld back to prior the explosion or not.
sign-restoration: true

# The "tree-physics" option will determine if the plugin will take control over trees and perform its magic.
tree-physics: false

# The "tree-regeneration" option determines if a block part of the tree physics will regenerate after a delay with a speed.
tree-regeneration: true

# The "tree-regeneration-speed" option is the integer (IN TICKS, 20 ticks = 1 second) that the tree regeneration process will use
# as its speed. The longer the duration, the longer the time in between block regeneration forming a more block-by-block design.
tree-regeneration-speed: 2

# The "tree-regeneration-delay" option is the integer (IN TICKS, 20 ticks = 1 second) that the tree regeneration process will WAIT
# before starting the regeneration process.
tree-regeneration-delay: 300

# The "tree-animation" option determines if the plugin will animation the action by spawning falling blocks.
tree-animation: true

# The "tree-gravity-effect" option determines if the animation will look fancy or not (falling blocks last longer and "tree-animation" must be enabled).
tree-gravity-effect: true

# The "tree-drops" option determines if the tree's blocks will break normally and drop stuff or not.
tree-drops: true

# The "tree-replant" option determines if the trees should be automatically replanted.
tree-replant: true

# The "no-entity-explosions" determines if the plugin will block all entity explosion damage to blocks or not.
no-entity-explosions: false

# The "explosive-regeneration" option determines if a block damaged by an explosive will regenerate after a delay with a speed.
explosive-regeneration: true

# The "explosive-regeneration-speed" option is the integer (IN TICKS, 20 ticks = 1 second) that the explosive regeneration process will use
# as its speed. The longer the duration, the longer the time in between block regeneration forming a more block-by-block design.
explosive-regeneration-speed: 1

# The "explosive-regeneration-delay" option is the integer (IN TICKS, 20 ticks = 1 second) that the explosive regeneration process will WAIT
# before starting the regeneration process.
explosive-regeneration-delay: 20

# The "explosive-physics" option tells the plugin whether or not to spawn falling blocks as a form of decoration from explosions.
explosive-physics: false

# The "explosive-drops" option determines whether exploded blocks have drops or not.
explosive-drops: false

# The "explosive-tnt-ignite" option tells the plugin if tnt harmed by an entity explosion should be ignited, rather than taking the effect
# of other normal blocks.
explosive-tnt-ignite: true

# The "explosive-tnt-fuse" option tells the plugin what the fuse of harmed tnt blocks should be (IN TICKS, 20 ticks = 1 second). This
# option requires the "explosive-tnt-ignite" feature to be enabled.
explosive-tnt-fuse: 10

# The "blocked-entity-regeneration" is a list that will prevent explosive block regeneration entirely if the explosion was caused by an entity in this list.
blocked-entity-regeneration: [] # Remove square brackets before using a list here!
#  - "CREEPER"
#  - "OTHER_MOB"

# The "explosive-blocked-entities" is a list that will block explosive damage and effects toward all entity types found in the list.
explosive-blocked-entities:
  - "ARMOR_STAND"
  - "PAINTING"
  - "ITEM_FRAME"
  - "MINECART"

# The "place-removal" option determines if block placed by the player will regenerate after a delay.
place-removal: false

# The "place-removal-delay" option determines how long (IN TICKS, 20 ticks = 1 second) it will take for the block to be removed and reverted to the original material.
place-removal-delay: 20

# The "place-only-effected" list will act as a whitelist when the "place-removal" option is enabled and will ONLY remove the materials found in the list.
# (NOTE: This list will be avoided if it is empty.)
place-only-effected:
  - "TORCH"

# The "break-regeneration" option determines if block broken by the player will regenerate after a delay.
break-regeneration: false

# The "break-drops" option determines if blocks broken by the player drop items or not.
break-drops: true

# The "break-regeneration-delay" option determines how long (IN TICKS, 20 ticks = 1 second) it will take for the block to be regenerated
# to its original state.
break-regeneration-delay: 40

# The "break-only-effected" list will act as a whitelist when the "break-regeneration" option is enabled. All materials in the list will regenerate after a
# delay to their original material. (NOTE: This list will be avoided if it is empty.)
break-only-effected:
  - "ORE"

# The "invert-bmr" option will convert the "blocked-material-regeneration" into a whitelist from a blacklist.
invert-bmr: false

# The "blocked-material-regeneration" is a list that will prevent block regeneration entirely if its material is in the list.
blocked-material-regeneration:
  - "FIRE"
  - "TNT"

# The "invert-wb" option will convert the world-blacklist into a whitelist.
invert-wb: true

# The "world-blacklist" list will block all PTG actions in the defined worlds.
world-blacklist: [] # Remove square brackets before using a list here!
#  - "world"
#  - "other_world"

# The "avoided-materials" list should contain all materials that should be avoided like the black plague. Essentially these materials
# are safe from the plugins actions at all costs. (this does not stop block from being exploded)

  - "BEDROCK"
  - "OBSIDIAN"
